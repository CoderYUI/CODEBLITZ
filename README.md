CODEBLITZ!	
Why it’s the next best thing?
CodeBlitz will be an exciting, fast-paced platform designed to make learning coding fun and addictive! Think of it as a video game for coding, where you level up your skills by solving coding challenges and competing in coding battles.
The idea is simple: you tackle bite-sized coding tasks, get instant feedback on your solutions, and keep coming back for more. As you progress, you unlock streaks, badges, and daily challenges, which make learning feel like a thrilling game. Each challenge tests your coding ability, helping you build real-world problem-solving skills with every line of code.
*GENERATIVE IDEA*
WHAT is the psychology behind Duolingo’s addictiveness??
1.	Operant Conditioning: It uses positive reinforcement (rewards) and variable reinforcement (random rewards) to encourage users to keep learning.
2.	Instant Feedback: Immediate corrections help users learn quickly and stay engaged.
3.	Goal Setting: Small, achievable goals and progress tracking keep users motivated by showing how much they’ve accomplished.
4.	FOMO (Fear of Missing Out): Streaks make users feel compelled to return daily to avoid losing their progress.
5.	Cognitive Load Management: Short, bite-sized lessons make learning easier and less overwhelming.
6.	Social Influence: Leaderboards and challenges encourage users to compete and improve by seeing how they rank against others.

*SIMILARITIES*: (to help analyse better)
CodeBlitz and Duolingo are similar in several ways:
1.	Gamified Learning: Both use points, badges, and leaderboards to make learning fun and motivating.
2.	Progressive Learning: Start simple and gradually increase difficulty to keep users challenged.
3.	Instant Feedback: Users get immediate responses to their work, helping them improve in real time.
4.	Practice & Repetition: Both encourage regular practice to reinforce learning and skill development.
5.	Community Features: Both have social elements like leaderboards and challenges to motivate users through friendly competition.
6.	Accessibility: Available on multiple devices, making learning convenient anytime, anywhere.

*How is it better!!* 
CodeBlitz is better than Duolingo for those interested in coding because:
1.	Real-World Skills: Teaches practical programming skills, useful for tech jobs.
2.	Competitive Learning: Gamified challenges and leaderboards make learning exciting.
3.	Industry Relevance: Focuses on tech skills needed for coding interviews.
4.	Hands-On Practice: Active problem-solving helps users apply what they learn right away
Building requirements!:
Core Features (MVP)
1.	User Accounts: Basic sign-up/login to get started with minimal data (username, email, password).
2.	Basic Challenges: Start small with just a few coding challenges, keeping the scoring simple.
3.	Instant Feedback: Use an easy-to-integrate code evaluation API like Judge0 for instant feedback, skipping the need for a custom evaluation engine.
4.	Streaks & Rewards: Focus on a basic daily streak feature for challenge completion instead of complex rewards.
Tech Stack
1.	Frontend: Stick to HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to get things up quickly. No need for frameworks like React right now.
2.	Backend: Use Flask (Python) for a lightweight, easy-to-setup backend.
3.	Database: Go with SQLite—it’s simple to use and avoids the hassle of more complex database setups.
4.	Code Evaluation: Leverage Judge0 or similar APIs for running user-submitted code.
Design
1.	UI/UX: Keep it simple. Use Figma to design a clean interface with a few key pages (Home, Challenges, Leaderboard, Profile).
2.	Animations: Limit animations to basic transitions to keep things smooth and user-friendly, without complicating the design.
