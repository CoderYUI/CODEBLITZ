# Overview

CODEBLITZ!	
Why it’s the next best thing?
CodeBlitz will be an exciting, fast-paced platform designed to make learning coding fun and addictive! Think of it as a video game for coding, where you level up your skills by solving coding challenges and competing in coding battles.
The idea is simple: you tackle bite-sized coding tasks, get instant feedback on your solutions, and keep coming back for more. As you progress, you unlock streaks, badges, and daily challenges, which make learning feel like a thrilling game. Each challenge tests your coding ability, helping you build real-world problem-solving skills with every line of code.

- 	**Operant Conditioning:** It uses positive reinforcement (rewards) and variable reinforcement (random rewards) to encourage users to keep learning.
-	**Instant Feedback:** Immediate corrections help users learn quickly and stay engaged.
-	**Goal Setting:** Small, achievable goals and progress tracking keep users motivated by showing how much they’ve accomplished.
-	**FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):** Streaks make users feel compelled to return daily to avoid losing their progress.
-	**Cognitive Load Management:** Short, bite-sized lessons make learning easier and less overwhelming.
-	**Social Influence:** Leaderboards and challenges encourage users to compete and improve by seeing how they rank against others.

## Why CodeBlitz?
1.	**Real-World Skills:** Teaches practical programming skills, useful for tech jobs.
2.	**Competitive Learning:** Gamified challenges and leaderboards make learning exciting.
3.	**Industry Relevance:** Focuses on tech skills needed for coding interviews.
4.	**Hands-On Practice:** Active problem-solving helps users apply what they learn right away
